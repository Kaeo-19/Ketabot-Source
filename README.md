# Ketabot

Alright, it's been quite some time that I've posted *anything* on the internet, let alone a full blown github project. I've been back at home after a perilous three year journey of personal hardships and since being home I've decided to continue working on this discord bot. Originally it had been planned for a discord server that no longer exists, for a person who no longer wishes to remain in contact with me, so I've decided to continue developing it for the general public to use. Do note that this is literally release 1. There are a lot of bugs. This is still heavily changing on an hourly basis! So far, however, since the last update to this repo, A few things have been added, such as:

* A profile system (still a work in progress):
  * Automatically creates user profiles when they join
  * Can view said profiles in chat

* Prototype economy based commands (Also a work in progress):
  * Each player is given a wallet
  * Allows transfering of credits

Do note this is a rough draft, essentially. The final product is still a bit a ways away, and I hope to include some of the following (do note this is subject to change, this is simply so I can put a concrete list of what I hope to have this bot be able to do for a standard discord server):
* Full Fledged economy support:
  * User shops (Buy, sell, or trade items for currency/items)
  * Server Issued-Jobs that will allow users to "work" for currency, or for an item.
  * Random Item drops/Currency drops, so that the economy doesn't entirely hinge on a "axe to the grindstone" mentality. You might get rich overnight? who the hell knows.

* Additions to the profile system:
  * Add an experience/trait system, whereupon users level up based on activity (job completion/ontime/chat activity) Certain traits will allow users to complete certain jobs easier

I honestly think I'm recreating the old text dungeons and dragons shit from the 90's, but I think it would be cool to bring something like that to discord eventually, and even have a dedicated server for something like that, with private user channels dedicated to advancing solo quests. (maybe?)
